  /// This has two major purposes in the suffix tree. The first is as a
  /// shortcut in Ukkonen's construction algorithm. One of the things that
  /// Ukkonen's algorithm does to achieve linear-time construction is
  /// keep track of which node the next insert should be at. This makes each
  /// insert O(1), and there are a total of O(N) inserts. The suffix link
  /// helps with inserting children of internal nodes.
  ///
  /// Say we add a child to an internal node with associated mapping S. The 
  /// next insertion must be at the node representing S - its first character.
  /// This is given by the way that we iteratively build the tree in Ukkonen's
  /// algorithm. The main idea is to look at the suffixes of each prefix in the
  /// string, starting with the longest suffix of the prefix, and ending with
  /// the shortest. Therefore, if we keep pointers between such nodes, we can
  /// move to the next insertion point in O(1) time. If we don't, then we'd
  /// have to query from the root, which takes O(N) time. This would make the
  /// construction algorithm O(N^2) rather than O(N).
  ///
  /// The suffix link is also used during the tree pruning process to let us
  /// quickly throw out a bunch of potential overlaps. Say we have a sequence
  /// S we want to outline. Then each of its suffixes contribute to at least
  /// one overlapping case. Therefore, we can follow the suffix links
  /// starting at the node associated with S to the root and "delete" those
  /// nodes, save for the root. For each candidate, this removes
  /// O(|candidate|) overlaps from the search space. We don't actually
  /// completely invalidate these nodes though; doing that is far too
  /// aggressive. Consider the following pathological string:
  ///
  /// 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3
  ///
  /// If we, for the sake of example, outlined 1 2 3, then we would throw
  /// out all instances of 2 3. This isn't desirable. To get around this,
  /// when we visit a link node, we decrement its occurrence count by the
  /// number of sequences we outlined in the current step. In the pathological
  /// example, the 2 3 node would have an occurrence count of 8, while the
  /// 1 2 3 node would have an occurrence count of 2. Thus, the 2 3 node
